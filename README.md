# SmartDrop ðŸª‚ðŸ¤‘

This project was built during the [Onchain Summer Buildathon](https://devfolio.co/projects/smart-faucet-9fe1) 

## Overview
SmartDrop is a solution designed to simplify and secure the process of token distribution in the crypto world. Whether dealing with ERC-20 tokens, native currencies, or NFTs, SmartDrop aims to address common challenges in the token distribution process, including technical complexities, security risks, and centralization.



## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/koshikraj/smart-drop.git
    ```

    Project structure:

    â”œâ”€â”€ module-template-7579 <br/>
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ [Safe App](./web)<br/>
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [Module](./module)


2. Install dependencies

    ```bash

    ```

3. Run module tests

    ```bash
    cd module
    npm run test
    ```

4. Run web app

    cd web
    npm run dev
    ```



## Key Features
1. **Ease of Use**: SmartDrop makes it easy to set up token drop contracts and apps, reducing the technical know-how required.
2. **Security**: By leveraging secure smart accounts like Safe and Coinbase, SmartDrop minimizes the risk of losing tokens due to flawed distribution contracts.
3. **Decentralization**: SmartDrop eliminates the need for offline distribution strategies, ensuring a more decentralized approach.
4. **Account Abstraction**: Utilizes ERC-4337 spec for gasless transactions and bundling, enhancing the user experience and making token distribution smoother and more user-friendly.

## Benefits
- **Direct Distribution**: SmartDrop enables direct distribution without the need for escrow, utilizing the security features of smart accounts.
- **Reduced Centralization**: By encoding the token distribution strategy in a module attached to a smart account, the process becomes more decentralized.
- **Enhanced Security**: Strong security features built into smart accounts help safeguard tokens during distribution.
